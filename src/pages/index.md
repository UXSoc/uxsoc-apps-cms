          The President is the highest ranking executive in the organization. He
          or she is in charge of establishing the vision and mission for the
          organization and making sure it can be translated to a portfolio of
          projects and events during his/her term.




          He or she is responsible for leading the growth of the entire
          organization and also should be open to mentoring the next set of
          leaders for the organization. The President is also responsible for
          coordinating with LIONS, Ateneo admin and other offices, as well as
          external UX Society chapters. He or she shall be willing to guide
          interested students outside of Ateneo de Manila that may be interested
          in founding their own UX Society chapter for their respective
          universities.

          communication, persuasion, ability to handle conflict, good judgment

          The EVP is the right hand of the President. He or she fills in the
          gaps the President cannot fill. Together with the President, they are
          unbreakable in advocating User Experience.




          He or she is the leader of all the vice presidents. He or she should
          be deeply concerned with each of their growth and as much as possible
          schedule individual consultations, hold honest conversations, and find
          the root of the matter whenever they do not perform well as well as
          address all internal conflicts within the executive board. He or she
          ensures that UXSoc continues to grow in the quality of initiatives and
          prepares the organization for continuous growth across different
          chapters alongside the president and directly reports to LIONS as part
          of the legislative committee.




          Your strong sense of empathy for the organization’s people, standards
          of quality and growth, and can-do attitude takes the organization far
          more than it could be without you.
