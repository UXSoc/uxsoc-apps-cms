          UX Society empowers people through design education, enlightens them
          to the power of design, and nurtures them to create meaningful
          products for the community
        title: Mission
      - description: >-
          **Champion authentic user empathy**


          We at UX Society will always strive to empathize with our members. We
          listen to your needs, suggestions, opinions, and goals in the
          organization and translate these into projects, events, and
          initiatives to serve you better.


          **Foster a collaborative environment**


          At UX Society, you will never be alone. Every project or initiative is
          done in a collaborative manner. Everyone is part of the team. Don't be
          afraid to ask help, mentorship, or advice.


          **Value delivery over perfection**


          We want to maximize the value we give to our members. We believe that
          what we do does not have to be perfect to produce strong results.
          Completion produces results. Perfectionism delays and kills results.


          **Maintain a shared sense of purpose**


          Our advocacy is what binds us together in UX Society. This is our
          north star. Everything we do is always guided by our drive to
          establish the importatn role of design in the community through the
          products we create, the events we hold, the speakers we invite, and
          the chapters we create.


          **Establish and uphold standards of quality**


          We believe that quality work we put out in the community represents
          who we are as an organization. Therefore, we aspire to create the best
          products that will not only help the community, but create an
          awareness that will transform people's perception of design.
