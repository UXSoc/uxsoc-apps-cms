          At UX Society, you will never be alone. Every project or initiative is
          done in a collaborative manner. Everyone is part of the team. Don't be

          who we are as an organization. Therefore, we aspire to create the best
          products that will not only help the community but create an awareness
          that will transform people's perception of design.

          I had my first UXSoc event experience in the General Assembly last
          2018. I like that it was very informative in terms of explaining the
          purpose of the organization and the different positions that come with
          it. I also like the activities that help the audience showcase their
          creativity such as the paper folding activity. I didn't find anything
          unlikable about the event, and my experience actually made me want to
          attend more events since it properly showcased the future events that
          they'll be holding, piquing the interest of the attendees.

          I joined UXSoc with no knowledge of coding or design in general but
          seeing my friends develop their skills through workshops in this org
          really made me wanna try it out. This prompted me to become an officer
          in my first year so that I can feel more involved with the org and it
          did. By interacting with the VPs and other officers I decided to join
          UX University where I got to learn the basics of Figma by our guest
          speaker. Sadly, I haven't been able to practice Figma but its always
          nice that I can pick up from where I left off because of this org.

          When I joined UXSociety, I had little to no experience in design.
          Because of my course, I wanted to join an org that showed me how to
          work with coding, but also enabled me to tap into my more creative
          side. The first event I attended from UXSoc was the UX General
          Assembly in 2019. It was in this event that I experienced just how
          committed the officers and its members are to UXSoc's vision and
          mission - all while still having fun and enjoying each other's
          company. I still have a long way to go on my UX journey, but everybody
          has to start somewhere, and I'm glad I took the leap and applied for
          the org!
