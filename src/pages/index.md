      The EVP is the right hand of the President. He or she fills in the gaps
      the President cannot fill. Together with the President, they are
      unbreakable in advocating User Experience.


      He or she is the leader of all the vice presidents. He or she should be
      deeply concerned with each of their growth and as much as possible
      schedule individual consultations, hold honest conversations, and find the
      root of the matter whenever they do not perform well as well as address
      all internal conflicts within the executive board. He or she ensures that
      UXSoc continues to grow in the quality of initiatives and prepares the
      organization for continuous growth across different chapters alongside the

      committee.
       
      Your strong sense of empathy for the organization’s people, standards of
      quality and growth, and can-do attitude takes the organization far more
      than it could be without you.
