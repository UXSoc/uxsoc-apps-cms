          The President is the highest ranking executive in the organization. He
          or she is in charge of establishing the vision and mission for the
          organization and making sure it can be translated to a portfolio of
          projects and events during his/her term.


          He or she is responsible for leading the growth of the entire
          organization and also should be open to mentoring the next set of
          leaders for the organization. The President is also responsible for
          coordinating with LIONS, Ateneo admin and other offices, as well as
          external UX Society chapters. He or she shall be willing to guide
          interested students outside of Ateneo de Manila that may be interested
          in founding their own UX Society chapter for their respective
          universities.


          It’s recommended that the President has the skills of effective
          communication, persuasion, ability to handle conflict, good judgment
          and past experience on leadership and team management.

          The EVP is the right hand of the President. He or she fills in the
          gaps the President cannot fill. Together with the President, they are
          unbreakable in advocating User Experience.


          He or she is the leader of all the vice presidents. He or she should
          be deeply concerned with each of their growth and as much as possible
          schedule individual consultations, hold honest conversations, and find
          the root of the matter whenever they do not perform well as well as
          address all internal conflicts within the executive board. He or she
          ensures that UXSoc continues to grow in the quality of initiatives and
          prepares the organization for continuous growth across different
          chapters alongside the president and directly reports to LIONS as part
          of the legislative committee.


          Your strong sense of empathy for the organization’s people, standards
          of quality and growth, and can-do attitude takes the organization far
          more than it could be without you.

          The VP for Consultancy is in charge of client projects, whilst
          advocating for product (and project!) management within UX Society. 


          Whilst UX Consultancy, UX Design, and Engineering are the staple
          income generating departments of UXSoc, clientwork may also involve
          other departments. These client projects will serve as a practice
          ground for UXSoc AVPs and officers to hone their product management,
          research, design, and development skills in real-life projects. 


          For clientwork, the VP for Consultancy must be ready to pitch UXSoc’s
          various services to clients, quote the right prices, negotiate
          reasonably with stakeholders, and to ensure the project team is able
          to deliver a top-notch output within a reasonable timeframe. Ideally,
          he/she must have had freelance experience to be able to quote
          properly, but tremendous project management and people management
          skills are highly required and are non-negotiables! 


          Some responsibilities the VP for Consultancy is expected to undertake
          for client-work: 


          * Lead a team of UX Researchers, Product Designers, and Developers

          * Take ownership of the entire project management cycle and product
          roadmap 

          * Establish close rapport with both internal stakeholders
          (researchers, designers, developers, finance, UXSoc Top 3) and
          external stakeholders (clients, end-users)

          * Ensure project is executed well from deployment to turnover
